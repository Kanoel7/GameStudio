                        To ensure that games are fun, fair, and interesting, this job requires a delicate balance between creativity and strategy; it cannot be undermined.
                        Designers coordinate with other members of the team in an attempt to enhance ideas and integrate outcomes of game testing.</p>

                        They can code, merge audiovisuals, fix bugs, and manage overall performance of the game.
                        Mostly, developers are organized into teams to use the skills of engineers, designers, and even artists, to produce an interesting game.</p>
